# 1.6 Deploy a supergraph on premises

In this lab section we are going to use graphQL **Apollo Gateway** to compose a supergraph from two existing subgraphs and deploy it on premises

## The Demo folder

In the demo folder you can find 2 graphQL services: races and matches.
They expose 2 federation-compatible subgraphs


A docker compose file to run the above services

## The gateway

Let's add a new Apollo Gateway service to out solution


Under demo, create a new folder named `gateway`

```bash
mkdir gateway
cd gateway
```

Initialize the new node application

```bash
npm init
```

The resulting package.json should look like this:

```json
{
  "name": "gateway-demo",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "./src/index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": ""
  },
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
```

Install the required packages

```bash
npm install apollo-server @apollo/gateway
```

and finally add an `index.js` file under `src` folder where we are going to create an Apollo Gateway instance.

```js
const { ApolloServer } = require("apollo-server");
const { ApolloGateway } = require("@apollo/gateway");
const { readFileSync } = require("fs");

const supergraphSdl = readFileSync("./src/supergraph.graphql").toString();

const gateway = new ApolloGateway({
  supergraphSdl,
});

const server = new ApolloServer({
  gateway,
});

const PORT = process.env.PORT || 4000;

server.listen({ port: PORT }).then(({ url }) => {
  console.log(`Server ready at ${url}`);
});
```

We now need to define `supergraph.graphql` and to do so we are going to use `rover CLI`

```bash
npm install -g @apollo/rover
```

To compose a supergraph schema from subgraphs we need a configuration file with the subgraphs information

In the root folder create `supergraph.yaml`

```yaml
subgraphs:
  races:
    routing_url: http://races:4001/graphql
    schema:
      subgraph_url: http://localhost:4001/graphql
  matches:
    routing_url: http://matches:4002/graphql
    schema:
      subgraph_url: http://localhost:4002/graphql
```

Because we are running this from docker compose we need to se tthe routing url hosts according to our compose file services.

We need to run the services to connect rover and save the supergraph schema to `src/supergraph.graphql`

```bash
docker compose up -d

rover supergraph compose --config ./supergraph.yaml > ./src/supergraph.graphql

docker compose down
```

Let's now create a `Dockerfile` for the gateway application

```Dockerfile
FROM node:18

WORKDIR /usr/src/app

COPY src ./src
COPY package.json ./
COPY supergraph.yaml ./

RUN npm install

CMD ["./src/index.js"]
```
and finally add the gateway server to `docker-compose.yaml`

```yaml
...
  gateway:
    build:
      context: ./gateway
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    environment:
      PORT: 4000
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    depends_on:
      - races
      - matches
...
```

Run docker compose and query the supergraph

```bash
docker compose up
```
